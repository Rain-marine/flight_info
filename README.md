# Analyzing a Flight Information Database

This is just a sample code. Due to the original data's confidentiality, the original codes connot be shared publicly. Hence this code doesn't contain much statistical operations.
Each "Question" file includes the answer to one or more analitical questions, described thoroughly in "report.pdf" file in resources folder.

## Description

The xlsx file is a sample dataset which is raw and inefficient for analyzing. The 02 code file is responsible for optimizing this dataset and export a usable csv dataset. 
This csv file is used in the rest of the code. In some codes a chart is plotted. The size and fonts of the charts may be incompatible with your compiler, you may need to set these details manually.
